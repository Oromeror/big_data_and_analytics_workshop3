# big_data_and_analytics_workshop3


It was analized how you could be improved the model of the sentiment-analysis.ipynb of this [repositorie](https://github.com/bigdata-unbosque/social-networks-analysis)

I decided to use [Random Forests](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html#sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier) algorithm.

Conclusions:

- The more data better the training and predictions
- The more data labeled better the predicted metrics
